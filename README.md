# Machine Learning Models Implementation in Python

This repository contains Python implementations of various machine learning models, including k-means, k-medoids, DBSCAN, and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with backpropagation.

## Models Implemented

1. **k-means**: A popular clustering algorithm that partitions data into k clusters based on their nearest mean.

2. **k-medoids**: A variation of k-means clustering, which uses actual data points as centroids, making it more robust to outliers.

3. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**: A density-based clustering algorithm that groups together closely packed points while marking points in low-density regions as outliers.

4. **MLP with Backpropagation**: A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network trained using the backpropagation algorithm, a common technique for optimizing neural networks.

## Getting Started

To use these implementations, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RanaMuzammil272/MachineLearning_Models_Implementations.git
